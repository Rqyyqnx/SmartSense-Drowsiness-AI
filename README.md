# SmartSense-Drowsiness-AI

A real-time AI system that detects driver **drowsiness** and **distraction** using just a standard webcam.  
Built for seamless dashcam integration, SmartSense improves road safety by detecting:

- 👁️ Eyes closed for too long (drowsiness)
- 🔄 Head turns left, right, or down (distraction)

🔊 **Smart audio and voice alerts** notify the driver instantly to refocus or take a break.
